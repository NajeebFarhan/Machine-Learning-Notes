## Main Challenges of Machine Learning(Incomplete)
**Problems because of Data**
1. **Insufficient Quality of Training Data**
2. Non-representative Training Data: dataset which do not cover every aspect, making generalization of the examples not good and can make inaccurate prediction if a new data is introduced is out of the range of the training dataset.
3. Poor-quality of Data: having lots of error, outliers and noise. You have to clean the data before
4. **Irrelevant Features**: Garbage in, garbage out

**Problems because of the algorithm**
1. **Overfitting the Training Data**: may give accurate result for the training set but not being able to generalize well when new data is introduced.
2. **Underfitting the Training Data**
