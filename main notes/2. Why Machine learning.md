1. Problems for which existing solutions require a lot of fine-tuning or long lists of rules(a machine learning model can often simplify code and perform better than the traditional approach)

2. Complex problems for which using a tradition approach yields no good solution(the best machine learning techniques can perhaps find a solution).
	
3. Fluctuating environments(a machine learning system can easily be retrained on new data, always keeping it up to date).

4. Getting insights about complex problems and large amounts of data.
	Machine learning can help humans learn. ML models can be inspected to see what they have learned(although for some models this can be tricky). For instance, once a spam filter has been trained on enough spam, it can easily be inspected to reveal the list of words and combinations of words that it believes are the best predictors of spam. Sometimes this will reveal unsuspected correlations or new trends, and thereby lead to a better understanding of the problem.
