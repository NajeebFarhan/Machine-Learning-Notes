In supervised learning, the training set you feed to the algorithm includes the desired solutions, called **labels**
## Task of supervised Learning
1. Classification - Prediction of class or category 
	e.g. Spam filter(spam or ham)
2. Regression - Prediction of numeric value
   e.g. House price, car mileage

Note that some regression models can be used for classification as well, and vice versa. For example, logistic regression is commonly used for classification, as it can output a value that corresponds to the probability of belonging to a given class (e.g., 20% chance of being spam).
