# What is Machine Learning
> Machine learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
> - Arthur Samuel, 1959

> A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.
> - Tom Mitchell, 1997

**Example**
Spam filter is a machine learning model that, given examples of spam emails(flagged by user) and examples of non-spam emails(ham), can learn to flag spam

- The examples that the system uses to learn are called training set
- Each training example is called a training instance(or sample)

* The part of a machine learning system that learns and makes predictions is called a model.
  E.g. Neural network and random forests
