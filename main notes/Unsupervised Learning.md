In unsupervised learning, the training data is unlabeled.

## Task
1. **Clustering:** Clustering algorithms group data based on similarities.
   a hierarchical clustering algorithm may also subdivide each group into smaller groups.

2. **Visualization algorithms:** they output a 2D or 3D representation of your data that can easily be plotted.

3. **Dimensionality reduction:** simplify the data without loosing too much information. One way is to merge several correlated features into one. This is called **feature extraction**
4. **Anomaly detection:** The system is shown mostly normal instances during training, so it learns to recognize them, and detect anomaly which looks different than other data.
   Ex. detecting unusual credit card transaction to prevent fraud.

5. **Association rule learning:** in which the goal is to dig into large amounts of data and discover interesting relations between attributes.
