There are so many different types of machine learning systems that it is useful to classify them in broad categories based on the following criteria:
1. How they are supervised during training([[Supervised Learning|supervised]], [[Unsupervised Learning|unsupervised]], [[Semi-supervised Learning|semi-supervised]], [[Self-supervised Learning|self-supervised]], and [[Reinforcement Learning|reinforcement learning]]).
2. Whether or not they can learn incrementally on the fly([[Online Learning|online]] versus [[Batch learning|batch learning]]).
3. Whether they work by simply comparing new data points to known data points, or instead by detecting patterns in the training data and building a predictive model, much like scientists do([[Instance-based Learning|instance-based]] versus [[Model-based Learning|model-based learning]])

**E.g.** spam filter is an online, model-based, supervised learning system.
